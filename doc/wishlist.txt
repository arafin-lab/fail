This file documents ideas/wishes especially from a Fail* *user* perspective.

 - Recurring Fail* API usage patterns in experiment/campaign implementations
   (that could be implemented in a reusable way, e.g. in a library that sits
   between the Fail* API and the experiment)
   * Fault-space pruning (FIXME elaborate)
   * Preparation vs. final experiment steps -> cmake-driven, automatically
     build 2 fail-client binaries? (FIXME elaborate)
   * ...

 - Campaign distribution: More foolproof host CPU load/local users/RAM usage
   examination
